1.Dataset Discription
The used dataset to conduct the present study is the CIC-
IDS2017 dataset designed by the Canadian Institute for
Cybersecurity (CIC). It is particularly crafted for IDS research.
The dataset consists of complex network traffic data capturing
widespread flow-type metrics based upon packet-level
information. The characteristics are essential to distinguish
normal and abusive traffic in network activity.
Dataset Overview
• Source: Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity (CIC),
University of New Brunswick
• Purpose: To assist in the process of evaluating and
developing IDS models to identify and classify various
cyberattacks.
• Includes marked examples of normal traffic in a network and
different types of attack scenarios (e.g., DoS, DDoS, Brute
Force, Infiltration, Botnet, Web attacks).



2. Proposed Model
In this paper, we employ a hybrid model consisting of an
Autoencoder for feature extraction and an XGBoost
classification based on it to solve the difficulties in the
CICIDS2017 dataset." The reason for using hybrid model is to
take advantage of the power of both machine learning and deep
learning. With the help of Autoencoders in learning feature
representations efficiently by reducing data complexity,
XGBoost is used to classify different attacks efficiently.
