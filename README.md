# IDS--Hybrid-Approch
Hybrid Intrusion Detection System Leveraging Machine Learning for Enhanced Network Security


The key objectives of this study are as follows:
• In order to examine anomaly detection mechanisms: Examine
various anomaly detection mechanisms in the context of IDS
to analyze their effectiveness in identifying abnormal patterns
and activity in network traffic related to healthcare data.
• Evaluating Hybrid Methodologies: Compare the performance
of hybrid approaches that combine conventional IDS tech-
niques with machine learning techniques to ensure enhanced
detection capabilities and lower false positives in the medical
environment.
• Optimize Feature Selection: Consider and implement feature
selection methods to identify the key characteristics that will
improve the performance of the IDS to achieve proper data
processing and accurate detection.
• In order to evaluate real-time performance: Test and analyze
the proposed IDS in real-time scenarios to ensure its applica-
bility and effectiveness in detection and response to cyber
attacks in healthcare networks.
